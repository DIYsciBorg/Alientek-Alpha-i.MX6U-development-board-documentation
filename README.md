The AlienTek【Punctual Atom】【正点原子】Alpha i.MX6U development board is a nicely designed and powerful kit. Too bad the wiki forum (http://www.openedv.com/docs/index.html) which hosts the resource files is permanently(?) down (even though all the sales outlets continue to point you to a dead site). I had to install some shady China file server downloader software, and manually copy long url links from a graphic image screenshot. To help others out (as well as to maintain my own document collection), I will host it all here.

*I make NO claims on the validity of the documentation and files contained. I am not the copywrite owner of any material collected here. I cannot guarantee there are no viruses, pirated materials, secrete coded messages, hidden instructions to blow up your computer, or China military grade bot-nets. Kidding aside; im just trying to make obtaining this information by users of the product easier, safer, and more reliable.*

As for the files contained, All are "exactly" as downloaded in the three large zip files, with the exception that:
1: I have de-nested unnecessarily reduntant folders
2: I have performed rudimentary Google translate on folder and file names to make it a bit easier to find what we are looking for
3: I have added an archival image of my unit's EMMC as it came from factory. This file does NOT boot from SD as far as I can tell. So it may be effectively useless.

BEWARE : Its a big repository. I have tried to eliminate redundancy, compact larger files (zip, < 100MB), and provide links to files already widely available. I will continue this work in the future. I kept folders in tact, and placed readme files to direct you to wiki pages with links when such items were removed.
